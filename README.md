# GPTidday

Welcome to GPTidday, the project that asks, "What if test repos could have a sense of humor?" If you were expecting a stoic enterprise app, please manage your expectations like a grown-up—preferably while holding a cup of coffee shaped like a rubber duck.

## What even is this?
Think of GPTidday as a sandbox for GPT-driven experiments, demos, and the occasional coding shenanigan. The codebase is intentionally small so you can focus on prototyping ideas without wading through the software equivalent of a phone book.

## Features (such as they are)
- **Compact codebase**: Small enough to fit in your mental RAM without running `swap`.
- **Humor included**: Comedy may vary by timezone and caffeine level.
- **Great for experiments**: Perfect for trying prompts, quick scripts, or seeing how many tests you can write before lunch.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo like you mean it.
2. Open the code in your editor of choice (or the one your team lead "strongly recommends").
3. Make changes, run tests, and tell your rubber duck everything will be fine.

## Contributing
Pull requests, issues, and dad jokes are welcome. If your change makes the codebase happier (or at least more functional), we'll probably merge it. Bonus points for adding comments that future-you won't regret.

## License
Check the repository for licensing information before deploying this to production, your fridge, or your neighbor's smart toaster.
