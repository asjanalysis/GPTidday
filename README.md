# Surf Capitola Mockup

A multi-page, static web recreation of the Capitola surf app mockup. Each page mirrors one of the reference screens, from the welcome hero to surf reports, hourly outlooks, exploration pins, and event picks.

## Pages
- **index.html** – Welcome splash with hero actions and two preview cards.
- **report.html** – Capitola surf report, tide snapshot, and camera list.
- **hourly.html** – Hourly temperature bars and tide progression.
- **explore.html** – Map-inspired pins plus neighborhoods and restaurants.
- **events.html** – Local events with personalized water and dining recommendations.

## Usage
Open any page directly in your browser, or serve the folder locally (for example, `python -m http.server 8000`) and browse to the file you want. All styling lives in `styles.css`.
